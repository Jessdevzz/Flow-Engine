# Flow-Engine
Roblox parkour reimagined

Flow Engine is an open source Roblox movement system designed for my "NEON" Roblox game and any future projects requiring advanced movement capibilities
Flow Engine is early in development, and has no guarentee of being maintained. It is just a passion project.

-- Verson info --
Main: The stable version
Nightly: The unstable version for testing new features and tweaks
PPO (pre point 0): contains massive cutting edge features for testing, ppo will only be moved to main when a X.0 version releases (1.0, 2.0, ect)
